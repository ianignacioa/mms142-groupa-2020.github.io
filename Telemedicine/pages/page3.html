                                    Mostly the same as physical consultation. We
                                    sent my parents’ laboratory results through
                                    Viber and explained it to us through a Zoom
                                    meeting. But services can really be limited
                                    especially when you are needed to be
                                    physically inspected. Teleconsultation can
                                    be great for initial check-ups.”

So I think my consultation with the doctor is not worth it since the rate is just the same as traditional consultations. The doctor cannot see clearly if you have cysts or some rashes in your body.</p>

But knowing the situation about the internet connection in our country, sometimes there are technical difficulties so you cannot clearly hear each other. Some also consider sending results during consultations a hassle, though for some it is convenient. Prescriptions are easier to understand since they send digital copies of it instead of handwritten. Though I do believe traditional or usual physical consultations are still better in some cases. During physical consultations, we can express thoroughly how we feel and what we feel. You can also see actual presentations of the results of your tests, most especially if they are also done physically. Other than that, you are able to communicate with the doctor without interruptions.”</p>

                                    Telemedicine has been a major beneficiary of the proliferation of technological innovations and has the potential to revolutionize the delivery of healthcare. The “practice of telemedicine” is known to be a remote diagnosis and treatment of patients utilizing telecommunication technologies and electronic information. Apparently, the unprecedented surge in illness due to the current global pandemic (COVID-19) significantly increases the demand for interest in this innovative health care service.

                                    The basic premise of telemedicine is to provide convenience and reduce the amount of travel required for both physician and patients which possibly leads to cost savings. It also supports efforts to improve the quality of healthcare by expanding accessibility and efficiency through providing clinical support (treatment and follow-up care) for both healthcare providers and patients. Utilizing communication devices overcomes geographic barriers and allows providers to treat patients at home and expand health care services in remote areas.

                                    The practice of telemedicine is diverse, experimental, evolving and at the same time disrupting the traditional health care delivery. Despite its advocates, during this global pandemic telemedicine has been challenged. Since there are services a physician cannot provide with telemedicine, without a “face-to-face” consultations and examinations between provider and patient is not indicative of “real” nursing and can possibly lead to misdiagnosis. The fail to render the same level of assistance as hands-on care, regulations that impede telemedicine, and inadequate telemedicine applications patently deemed as threat to patient’s safety.

                                    Evidently, we are still in the early stage of practicing telemedicine and we cannot completely consider this disruptive innovation to replace the traditional health care delivery. Therefore, as with any disruptive innovation the success of telemedicine requires time, validation, strategic planning, and the right catalyst to be able to surmount possible dilemmas such as but not limited to infrastructure, costs and reimbursement, human factors, and equipment and technology issues.
