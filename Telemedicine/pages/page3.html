So I think my consultation with the doctor is not worth it since the rate is just the same as traditional consultations. The doctor cannot see clearly if you have cysts or some rashes in your body.

I had no choice but to do it online since it was the time when covid started and it was really strict around here.”

                                    “Telemedicine is convenient when it comes to appointments. No need to wait for hours in line, there is no need to travel as well. But knowing the situation about the internet connection in our country, sometimes there are technical difficulties so you cannot clearly hear each other. Some also consider sending results during consultations a hassle, though for some it is convenient. Prescriptions are easier to understand since they send digital copies of it instead of handwritten. Though I do believe traditional or usual physical consultations are still better in some cases. During physical consultations, we can express thoroughly how we feel and what we feel. You can also see actual presentations of the results of your tests, most especially if they are also done physically. Other than that, you are able to communicate with the doctor without interruptions.”

                            Telemedicine cannot be a full replacement for traditional or physical consultations since most of the consultations require you to be checked physically. But it can be great for initial consultations that do not need you to be physically present or take laboratory tests yet. It can bring convenience and ensure safety to patients because they wouldn’t need to travel and wait in line at the hospitals. Patients who do physical consultations may also benefit from this since this can help decrease the number of patients who go to hospitals. Although, this may not be for everyone since it requires you a mobile device/computer and a stable internet connection for a comfortable experience.
